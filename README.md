# FunWithAssembly
a place to tinker around with and learn assembly language. No prior experience required.

The purpose of this repository is for new users to learn the theory of programming in assembler. It is not necessarily meant to enforce best practices. Therefore, please try to follow the very simplistic conventions used in the Makefile (no variables or substitutions, everything easily googlable). 

Any program submitted to this repository must compile by typing "make all" or "make <program name>" and must run by typing "./<program name>".

additionally, please add appropriate descriptions to the "Program Reference Sheet" for any program you add. The rule of thumb to use is that anybody above age 5 should be able to run your program from scratch and understand fully what it does.
